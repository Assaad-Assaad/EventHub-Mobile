# üì± Event Hub

**Event Hub** is a cross-platform mobile application built with **.NET MAUI**. It allows users to browse, register for, and manage events. The app features both online and offline capabilities, using a custom ASP.NET Core API and local storage for a seamless user experience.

---

## üöÄ Project Structure

The solution consists of **three main projects**:

1. **EventHub.API**  
   ASP.NET Core Web API responsible for:
   - Serving event data
   - Handling user authentication (via Identity Framework)
   - Providing secure endpoints using JWT tokens

2. **EventHub.Shared**  
   A shared .NET Standard or .NET Core class library:
   - Contains common DTOs
   - Includes shared utility classes used by both the API and mobile app

3. **EventHub.MobileApp**  
   A .NET MAUI mobile application:
   - Core UI and user-facing functionality
   - Works offline using SQLite
   - Authenticates with the API using JWT
   - Stores and retrieves user data and events locally when offline
